# Streamhaul — Implementation Plan & Tracker

**This is the living tracking document for building Streamhaul.** It decomposes the design in
[`LLD.md`](./LLD.md) into PR-sized tasks across the 8 build phases. Update it in the **same PR** that
completes a task (one task ≈ one PR). It is the source of truth for "what's done, what's next."

- **Design:** [`LLD.md`](./LLD.md) · **Product:** [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md) · **Rules:** [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md)
- **Every task** follows the CLAUDE.md quality gate: implement → tests → **`bug-bot`** → **`code-reviewer`**
  (→ `security-engineer` if it touches crypto/auth/transport) → fix → PR → green CI → merge. No exceptions.

## Status legend
`☐` Todo · `🟡` In progress · `✅` Done · `⛔` Blocked · `🔬` In review/gate

## How to use
1. Pick the next unblocked task whose dependencies are `✅`.
2. Branch `‹type›/‹task-id›-slug` (e.g. `feat/P0-3-shp-video-header`).
3. Implement to the task's **Exit criteria** + **Tests**; run the quality gate.
4. In the PR, flip the task to `✅` and fill the **PR** column. Update the phase gate when all its tasks pass.

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams (run continuously, not a phase)

| ID | Workstream | Notes | Agent | Status |
|----|-----------|-------|-------|:------:|
| X-1 | **CI activation** | ✅ Live: `pr-title`/`lint`/`test` (3 OSes)/`audit` now run real Rust gates; toolchain pinned (1.95.0). **Pending:** coverage gate (`cargo-llvm-cov` ≥80% on `sh-protocol`/`sh-crypto`/`sh-transport`), cross-OS clippy (lands with platform crates, P0-6), and an MSRV-verification job. | devops-engineer | 🟡 |
| X-2 | **Testing infra** | `LoopbackTransport`, injected `Clock`+seedable RNG, `proptest`, `cargo-fuzz` targets, `loom` for lock-free queues. Build incrementally with each crate. **Started:** proptest in use (sh-types/sh-protocol); first `cargo-fuzz` target `shp_decode` (P0-3). **Pending:** a scheduled nightly fuzz job; `LoopbackTransport` (P0-4); `loom`; coverage gate. | qa-engineer, rust-staff-engineer | 🟡 |
| X-3 | **Security review cadence** | `security-engineer` reviews **every** crypto/auth/transport PR; `cargo audit` clean; document `snow` unaudited status. | security-engineer | ☐ |
| X-4 | **Release engineering** | `xtask` for packaging/signing; signed releases (Sigstore/cosign), SBOM (CycloneDX), per-OS installers/services. | devops-engineer | ☐ |
| X-5 | **Open decisions** | Resolve LLD §9 items before they block: Noise pattern names (SHA-256, before P3), platform-attestation envelope, UGC lifetime per compliance tier, `str0m` Safari interop (before P4/5). | software-architect, security-engineer | ☐ |

## Phase 0 — Hello Pixels (latency lab)

> Goal: prove the latency budget on the thinnest vertical slice. Windows host → native client, LAN, H.264,
> **bare `quinn` QUIC (no ICE/crypto)**, no adaptivity. Validates codec/render pipeline in isolation.
>
> **Scaffolding note (P0-1):** the workspace ships 10 portable `sh-*` libs + 2 bins. The platform/codec
> crates `sh-codec-hw` (P0-7) and `sh-platform-win` (P0-6), and the bindings `sh-ffi`/`sh-wasm` (P5/P8),
> are created **with their tasks** — they need real platform code to compile cross-OS, so adding empty
> stubs now would break `cargo test` on the Linux/macOS CI runners.

Meanwhile it is fenced by a non-default feature, an `InsecureLanLab` witness, and a `compile_error!` that blocks `--release --features insecure-lan`. | P4 | security-engineer |
